---

### 4. Category Model
**Purpose**: Classify books into different categories
**Fields**:

**Business Logic**:
- **Issue Process**:
  1. Select available book (status = 'Y')
  2. Select registered student
  3. Set issue date (current date)
  4. Calculate return date (current date + settings.return_days)
  5. Set issue_status = 'N'
  6. Change book status to 'N' (unavailable)

- **Return Process**:
  1. Find book issue record
  2. Set issue_status = 'Y'
  3. Set return_day = current date
  4. Change book status back to 'Y' (available)
  5. Calculate fine if overdue

**Fine Calculation**:
```
Fine = (Current Date - Return Date) × Settings.fine_per_day
Only applied if: Current Date > Return Date AND issue_status = 'N'
```

---
