## Integration Points

### Database Tables Needed
```sql
-- For Recommendations
CREATE TABLE book_recommendations (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id BIGINT,
    book_id BIGINT,
    score DECIMAL(3,2),
    algorithm_type VARCHAR(50),
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- For Fraud Detection
CREATE TABLE fraud_alerts (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id BIGINT,
    risk_score INT,
    flags JSON,
    status VARCHAR(20),
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- For Reservations
CREATE TABLE book_reservations (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    book_id BIGINT,
    student_id BIGINT,
    priority INT,
    status VARCHAR(20),
    reserved_at TIMESTAMP,
    estimated_availability DATETIME
);
```

### Service Provider Registration
```php
// In app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php
public function register()
{
    $this->app->singleton(BookRecommendationEngine::class);
    $this->app->singleton(LibraryFraudDetection::class);
    $this->app->singleton(DynamicFineCalculator::class);
}
```

### API Routes Addition
```php
// In routes/api.php
Route::middleware('auth:sanctum')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/recommendations/{student}', [RecommendationController::class, 'index']);
    Route::post('/fraud-check/{student}', [FraudController::class, 'check']);
    Route::get('/analytics/forecast', [AnalyticsController::class, 'forecast']);
});
```

## Expected Outcomes

### Performance Improvements
